PART 3: Recognizer
The objective of this section is to "put it all together". Using the four feature sets created and the three model selectors, you will experiment with the models and present your results. Instead of training only five specific words as in the previous section, train the entire set with a feature set and model selector strategy.
Recognizer Tutorial
Train the full training set
The following example trains the entire set with the example features_ground and SelectorConstant features and model selector. Use this pattern for you experimentation and final submission cells.
In [28]:
# autoreload for automatically reloading changes made in my_model_selectors and my_recognizer
%autoreload 2

from my_model_selectors import SelectorConstant

def train_all_words(features, model_selector):
    training = asl.build_training(features)  # Experiment here with different feature sets defined in part 1
    sequences = training.get_all_sequences()
    Xlengths = training.get_all_Xlengths()
    model_dict = {}
    for word in training.words:
        model = model_selector(sequences, Xlengths, word, 
                        n_constant=3).select()
        model_dict[word]=model
    return model_dict

models = train_all_words(features_ground, SelectorConstant)
print("Number of word models returned = {}".format(len(models)))
Number of word models returned = 112
Load the test set
The build_test method in ASLdb is similar to the build_training method already presented, but there are a few differences:
the object is type SinglesData
the internal dictionary keys are the index of the test word rather than the word itself
the getter methods are get_all_sequences, get_all_Xlengths, get_item_sequences and get_item_Xlengths
In [29]:
test_set = asl.build_test(features_ground)
print("Number of test set items: {}".format(test_set.num_items))
print("Number of test set sentences: {}".format(len(test_set.sentences_index)))
Number of test set items: 178
Number of test set sentences: 40
Recognizer Implementation Submission
For the final project submission, students must implement a recognizer following guidance in the my_recognizer.py module. Experiment with the four feature sets and the three model selection methods (that's 12 possible combinations). You can add and remove cells for experimentation or run the recognizers locally in some other way during your experiments, but retain the results for your discussion. For submission, you will provide code cells of only three interesting combinations for your discussion (see questions below). At least one of these should produce a word error rate of less than 60%, i.e. WER < 0.60 .
Tip: The hmmlearn library may not be able to train or score all models. Implement try/except contructs as necessary to eliminate non-viable models from consideration.

Question 3: Summarize the error results from three combinations of features and model selectors. What was the "best" combination and why? What additional information might we use to improve our WER? For more insight on improving WER, take a look at the introduction to Part 4.
Answer 3:
Recognizer Unit Tests
Run the following unit tests as a sanity check on the defined recognizer. The test simply looks for some valid values but is not exhaustive. However, the project should not be submitted if these tests don't pass.
In [49]:
from asl_test_recognizer import TestRecognize
suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromModule(TestRecognize())
unittest.TextTestRunner().run(suite)
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 34.886s

OK
