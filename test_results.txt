Recognizer Implementation Submission
For the final project submission, students must implement a recognizer following guidance in the my_recognizer.py module. Experiment with the four feature sets and the three model selection methods (that's 12 possible combinations). You can add and remove cells for experimentation or run the recognizers locally in some other way during your experiments, but retain the results for your discussion. For submission, you will provide code cells of only three interesting combinations for your discussion (see questions below). At least one of these should produce a word error rate of less than 60%, i.e. WER < 0.60 .
Tip: The hmmlearn library may not be able to train or score all models. Implement try/except contructs as necessary to eliminate non-viable models from consideration.

Question 3: Summarize the error results from three combinations of features and model selectors. What was the "best" combination and why? What additional information might we use to improve our WER? For more insight on improving WER, take a look at the introduction to Part 4.
Answer 3:
Recognizer Unit Tests
Run the following unit tests as a sanity check on the defined recognizer. The test simply looks for some valid values but is not exhaustive. However, the project should not be submitted if these tests don't pass.
In [64]:
from asl_test_recognizer import TestRecognize
suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromModule(TestRecognize())
unittest.TextTestRunner().run(suite)
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 33.590s

OK
Out[64]:
<unittest.runner.TextTestResult run=2 errors=0 failures=0>
